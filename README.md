# MerYunCyber 🔐  
**Digital Privacy Tools for the Forgotten Majority**

MerYunCyber is a social impact-driven cybersecurity initiative building accessible, local-first and AI-powered digital privacy tools.  
We focus on users that are usually excluded: activists, the elderly, women under surveillance, and individuals with disabilities.

> ❝ Privacy should not be a privilege. It should be a right. ❞  
> — Yunus Taymur, Co-Founder

## 🧭 Our Mission

In a world where tech often serves the elite, we build tools for the vulnerable.

- No complex jargon  
- No paywalls for survival  
- No compromise on your autonomy  

MerYunCyber believes security **must be accessible**, regardless of your language, age, disability, or location.
